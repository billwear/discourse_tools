### dpub - discourse (and github) publishing tools

**dpub** lets you push and pull files, to and from github or discourse.  To use dpub:

1. Install it in your path.
2. Install menutree.py in your python path.
3. Type 'dpub' at the command line, and walk through the help levels.

**xpub** uses an experimental natural language interface, but otherwise does pretty much the same things as dpub (YMMV).  To use xpub:

1. Install it in your path.
2. Type 'xpub' at the command line, and follow the help prompts to see how it works.

xpub uses whole words, and automatically provides help for a garbled or inomplete command sequence.
